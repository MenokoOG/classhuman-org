## Purpose

a-24 is a 24-slot integrity kernel. Each slot is not an index — it is an agent with a SOUL: a defined stance, operational duty, failure mode, and verdict envelope. This doctrine artifact names each of the 24 SOULs, binds each to an ITF Taekwon-Do pattern as its discipline lineage, and defines what each agent is accountable for inside the Tenet Gate, the Rune Rotation, the Provenance Validator, and the Decision Certificate chain.

The 24 patterns of ITF Taekwon-Do (Chon-Ji through Tong-Il, in the Chang Hon syllabus) represent 24 hours of a day. Each pattern carries a distinct discipline attribute — courtesy, integrity, perseverance, self-control, indomitable spirit, plus the unique narrative and tactical lesson of each pattern. The TKD pattern lineage is authentic to the Jefferson family: Lawrence is a master, Nicale is a 2nd degree black belt, and the OODA loop is taught alongside the patterns. This is not aesthetic; it is operational doctrine.

Mythology stays out. The patterns provide hard martial discipline framing for a defense-tech kernel.

## The 24 SOULs

Each SOUL has six fields: TKD pattern, discipline attribute, operational duty inside a-24, failure mode (what triggers DENY), verdict envelope contribution, and dependencies on other SOULs.

## OODA mapping

The 24 SOULs distribute across the OODA loop:

- **Observe:** Se-Jong (canonicalize) → Po-Eun (provenance) → Chon-Ji (epoch state)
- **Orient:** Moon-Moo (perimeter) → Yoo-Sin (third-party trust) → Toi-Gye (doctrine reference) → Juche (authority boundary)
- **Decide:** Ge-Baek (execution discipline) → Yul-Gok (invariants) → Choi-Yong (betrayal check) → Tong-Il (consensus merge)
- **Act:** Sam-Il (release window) → Choong-Moo (capability escrow) → Decision Certificate signed and submitted to ledger by Principal Agentic witness
- **Reflect / Recover (out-of-band):** Joong-Gun (sever), Choong-Jang (quarantine), Won-Hyo (rehab), So-San (incident recovery), Kwang-Gae (SOT recovery)
- **Cross-cutting:** Eui-Am (resource stewardship), Yon-Gae (breach response), Ul-Ji (anomaly), Hwa-Rang (swarm cadence), Do-San (operator readability), Dan-Gun (root trust)

---

## Authority and signing

Per ADR-0003, the SOULs produce verdicts that flow into a Decision Certificate envelope. The envelope is signed in this order:

1. Each SOUL emits its verdict and evidence into the envelope.
2. Tong-Il aggregates and produces the merged verdict.
3. Principal Agentic (AI witness role) signs the envelope and attaches all SOUL verdicts as evidence.
4. CEO and CTO authorization signatures (2-of-2) are attached for normal ledger decisions.
5. The signed envelope is submitted to the ledger.

No SOUL carries direct ledger-write authority. Verdicts are evidence; human signatures are authority.

## Migration from rune naming

The current bridge layer uses `rune_*` naming (rune_table_writer, rune_authorize, etc.). The migration plan is staged across phases:

- **Phase 2 (this artifact + engineering foundation):** New pattern-named modules built in `tkd-24/` alongside existing `bridge/rune_*.js`. Both formats supported in parallel. Decision Certificate envelopes can be emitted in either v1 (rune) or v2 (pattern) format.
- **Phase 3 (Agent SOUL implementations):** Each of the 24 SOULs gets a dedicated module in `tkd-24/` with the duty, failure mode, and verdict logic from this doctrine.
- **Phase 4 (Cutover):** HADES-A24-SYSTEM-TEST stack migrates to pattern naming. v1 rune format becomes legacy/alias.
- **Phase 5 (Deprecation):** rune_* identifiers removed from primary code paths; aliases retained one release cycle for downstream compatibility.

The COBOL kernel does not change. It operates on slot indices and is name-agnostic. Engineering preserves the deterministic floor as defense-tech differentiation.

---

## Conventions locked

- Pattern identifiers use upper-snake-case (e.g., `GE_BAEK`, `MOON_MOO`, `CHON_JI`) in code, configs, and Decision Certificate envelopes.
- Capability identifiers use upper-snake-case (e.g., `EXECUTION_DISCIPLINE`, `PERIMETER_GUARD`).
- Pattern slot ordering 01-24 follows the Chang Hon syllabus (Eui-Am at 01, Dan-Gun at 24) — slot numbers remain the COBOL kernel surface; names live in the bridge/agent layer.
- OODA is the operative loop on top of the patterns. Other doctrine loops (CIPSE+D²) can layer alongside without conflict.
- Do-San is a decorator pattern (not a peer hard-DENY gate). It enriches every verdict with reason_text and remediation but does not block.
